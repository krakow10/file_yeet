# File Yeet

A minimal client/server model to allow peers to share files directly when connected to the same server.

Uses TCP hole punching techniques to allow peers to transfer data directly. Special thanks to [TheOnlyArtz](https://github.com/TheOnlyArtz) for [this repo](https://github.com/TheOnlyArtz/rust-tcp-holepunch) because it served as a reference for hole punching techniques.
